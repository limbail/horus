<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project:
> Here's why:
> 
> * "The Eye of Horus is an ancient Egyptian symbol of protection"
> 
> * Your time should be focused on creating something amazing and not losing time with repetitive tasks, That's why I want to help save time specially SAP Consultants and Security teams.
> * SAP is not easy to understand and exist a big gap between SAP and Security. This project will help to have some clearly simple task done in the fast and correct way.
> * You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
